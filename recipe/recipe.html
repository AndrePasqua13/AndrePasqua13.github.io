<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p><strong> This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</strong>
    It has been adapted from a numbrx of different recipes that I
    have read over the years.</p>
<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>
    0<sup>2</sup>

    <em><mark><del><ins>can</del></ins> (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</mark></em><br>
    <em><mark>175g of tahini</mark></em><br>
    <em><mark>6 sundried tomatoes</mark></em><br>
    <em><mark>Half a red pepper</mark></em><br>
    <em><mark>A pinch of cayenne pepper</mark</em><br>
    <em>1 clove of garlic</em><br>
    <em>A dash of olive oil</em><br>
</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely<br>
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>
    Process all the ingredients into a paste.<br>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br>
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time<br>
</p>
<blockquote>For a different flavour</blockquote>
    ,you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
</p>

<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>
    <q>Refrigerate the finished hummus</q> in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
</p>

<p>
    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
